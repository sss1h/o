## Homework: Git,GitHub,and Markdown

**Description:** 

​    Create a set of documents in markdown and manage them using Git and GitHub.

**Purpose:**

​    Provide experience with creating markdown and using Git/GitHub.

**Requirements:**

​    This project is to be managed in a public Git Hub repository. For the challenge assignment submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository.

​    Create a directory (you choose its name) to hold the files for this challenge. This directory is to be managed by Git/GitHub. The master branch of the repository on GitHub is to hold your final work. You are to submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for there pository on GitHub.

​    Minimally the directory is to contain two markdown files. One is to be the README.md and the other is to be named whatever you'd like. You can have more if you wish. The markdown files are to be linked to each other so you can navigate from one to the other and back. The README.md, which serves as a homepage, is to have a link to the second markdown file and the second mark down file is to have a link back to README.md.

​    In the markdown you are to display an image that is a file in the directory and also another image that is file on the web. So,find or create an image you want to display and put it in the directory. Images need to be jpg ,Qpeg,png,or gif files.

​    Somewhere in the two mark down files minimally include the following:

1. an H2_sized header.
2. an H4_sized header.
3. a link to a nexternal website.
4. a link between markdown pages. Link from README.md to the second markdown file and from the second markdown file back to the README.md.
5. an image that is a file in the directory.
6. an image that is located on the web (not a file in the directory). If you right-click on an image in a web browser there is an option in the pop up to get the address/URL to the image.
7. a code block with syntax highlighting for the programming language being used. Put some example code in the code block. I don't care what code. Note that those three ticks that define a code block are backticks not apostrophes.
8. a block quote.
9. a bulleted list.
10. a numbered list.
11. a table.
12. bolded text.
13. italicized text.
14. strike through text~~like this~~.
15. a horizontal rule like the one that follows this list.

Which content goes on a given page or what the content is doesn't really matter. You are practicing creating mark down and managing a project using Git/GitHub in this challenge.

By the way, this challenge document was created with markdown!
