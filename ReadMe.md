## Git, GitHub and Markdown

#### What is Git?

*Git* is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
}

#### What is GitHub?

[GitHub:https://github.com](https://github.com)

> You could use Git on your standalone computer to manage some aspects of version control, but you would be missing some abilities that can only be obtained using a Git server such as collaboration and having a copy of the repository stored remotely for backup.

_GitHub_ is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

#### Advice

If you are already a Git/GitHub user, great! Keep working to refine your Git and GitHub skills and knowledge. Knowledge is power, so keep improving! A software engineer is expected to be knowledgeable and experienced with version control and specifically Git/GitHub.

~~If you are learning to use Git and GitHub~~

##### If you are learning to use Git and GitHub:

- don't avoid learning how to use Git and GitHub. It may seem confusing or difficult at the start, but once you gain some experience it will make sense and you will wonder how you ever worked without it or why it seemed difficult at first.

- the only real way to learn is by doing! Experience/practice makes things understandable. Don't avoid using Git/GitHub or attempt to not use them and then create a repository just to submit your work. Embrace the fact that you need to learn how to use them. You will be better off with all of your development work once you use version control and VCS hosting.

- don't avoid learning how to use Git/GitHub on the command line. There are things you can't do and problems you can't solve using only the GUI in an IDE.

- don't wait for a large, collaborative project before learning how to use Git and GitHub.
- Git/GitHub is useful for managing files for projects other than software development projects.



#### What is MakeDown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

 Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

 For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., ***\*this text is bold\****). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Atom text editor.
